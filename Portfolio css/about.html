        <h3>I'm Shiva, a Web Development Enthusiast based in Overland Park, KS.</h3>
        <p>
            For my current work stint, I work as consultant for One of America's leading telecomm newtork service provider. Being Part of a rapidly changing enterprise environment has helped me grow as a robust indvidual both Professionally and and Personally.I have
            a constant urge to learn and am fascianted by the idea of Team work.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am a Graduate from the University of Bridgport with a Master's Degree in Computer Science. Working through my projects during my course work at the Univeristy, HTML, CSS and JavaScript allured me into beliving how much fun it is to all and all improve
            user experience and feel with such minimal effort. it was then I decided to endure Web Development as my carrer path.
        </p>

        <p>
            Growing up in India with a very diverse upbringing, I had the oppertunity to learn and embrace different cultures. My propensity to be flexible and adjust according to the challenge has to do a lot with the fact that our family moved to a new city every
            two years because of my Dad's work.One quality that I have carried with myself is to be consistent at everything I do irrespective of the outcome. Firm beliver of "Failure is a lesson learnt" and "Success is not Definite". When on break, I
            am an avid reader and a vivid writer. Food for me is an emotion, different cusines is something I look forward to all the time.
